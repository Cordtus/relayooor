# Hermes Integration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of Hermes IBC relayer integration into the Relayooor system, completed on 2025-07-18.

## Key Components

### 1. Hermes Configuration (`/config/hermes/config.toml`)
- Configured for passive operation (no active relaying)
- Settings:
  - `mode.packets.enabled = true`
  - `clear_interval = 0` (disabled automatic clearing)
  - `clear_on_start = false`
- Chains configured:
  - Cosmos Hub (cosmoshub-4)
  - Osmosis (osmosis-1)
  - Noble (noble-1)
  - Stride (stride-1)
  - Jackal (jackal-1)
  - Axelar (axelar-dojo-1)

### 2. Authentication Handling (`/config/hermes/entrypoint.sh`)
- Custom entrypoint script that injects authentication into RPC/WebSocket URLs
- gRPC endpoints do not require authentication (per user feedback)
- Script parses config.toml and updates URLs with credentials from environment variables

### 3. API Integration
- **Simple API** (`/api`): Lightweight Go API for basic operations
- **Middleware API** (`/relayer-middleware/api`): Full-featured API with Cosmos SDK integration
- Both APIs expose Hermes metrics and packet clearing functionality

### 4. Packet Manager Application (`/packet-manager`)
- Vue.js 3 application for managing stuck IBC packets
- Features:
  - Chain and channel selection
  - Query stuck packets from Chainpulse
  - View Hermes metrics
  - Clear packets individually or in bulk
  - Cross-validation between data sources

## Docker Integration

### Services Modified
- `hermes`: Custom entrypoint for authentication
- `packet-manager`: New service for the packet management UI
- `chainpulse`: Extended configuration for additional chains

### Port Mappings
- 3010: Hermes telemetry (Prometheus metrics)
- 5185: Hermes REST API
- 5174: Packet Manager web interface

## Testing

A demonstration script was created at `/packet-manager/demo.sh` that:
1. Checks service health
2. Queries stuck packets from each chain
3. Verifies Hermes metrics accessibility
4. Demonstrates cross-validation between data sources

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: 
   - RPC/WebSocket connections use basic auth
   - gRPC connections do not require authentication
   - Credentials stored in environment variables

2. **API Access**:
   - Packet clearing requires wallet signature verification
   - Read operations are public

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The simple API currently uses mock data for packet clearing (not connected to actual Hermes instance)
2. Channel configuration is currently hardcoded - needs to be made dynamic
3. Some chains may not have Skip Protocol endpoints available

## Future Improvements

1. Implement dynamic channel discovery from overall relaying data
2. Connect simple API to actual Hermes instance for real packet clearing
3. Add more comprehensive error handling and retry logic
4. Implement websocket support for real-time updates
