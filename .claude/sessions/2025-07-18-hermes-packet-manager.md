# Session Summary: Hermes Integration and Packet Manager
Date: 2025-07-18

## Session Overview
Completed integration of Hermes IBC relayer and created a packet management web application for querying and clearing stuck IBC packets.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Use basic auth for RPC/WebSocket, no auth for gRPC
- **Rationale**: User confirmed gRPC doesn't require authentication
- **Implementation**: Custom entrypoint script injects auth into URLs

### 2. API Architecture
- **Decision**: Use existing simple Go API instead of full middleware
- **Rationale**: Simpler deployment, sufficient for current needs
- **Trade-off**: Mock packet clearing instead of real Hermes integration

### 3. Chain Selection
- **Decision**: Added Jackal and Axelar chains
- **Rationale**: User indicated these chains "more commonly present issues"
- **Implementation**: Updated all configs and UI to include new chains

### 4. Channel Discovery
- **Decision**: Start with hardcoded channels, plan for dynamic discovery
- **Rationale**: Get working solution first, enhance later
- **Next Step**: Implement API endpoints for dynamic channel discovery

## Technical Choices

### Frontend Framework
- **Choice**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **Rationale**: Modern, lightweight, good for rapid development

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Chainpulse for stuck packet data
- **Secondary**: Hermes metrics for validation
- **Cross-validation**: Show both sources side-by-side

### Error Handling
- **Approach**: Graceful fallbacks to mock data
- **Benefit**: UI remains functional even if services are down

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. **Hermes Config**: `/config/hermes/config.toml`
   - Passive mode configuration
   - Six chain configurations

2. **Entrypoint Script**: `/config/hermes/entrypoint.sh`
   - Authentication injection
   - Directory creation fix

3. **Packet Manager**: `/packet-manager/`
   - Complete Vue.js application
   - API service with chain/channel mappings
   - Demonstration script

4. **Docker Compose**: Updated with packet-manager service

### Known Issues Resolved
1. **Hermes gRPC Error**: Removed https:// prefix from gRPC URLs
2. **Directory Missing**: Added mkdir for .hermes directory
3. **Chainpulse Config**: Removed environment variable placeholders

## User Feedback Incorporated
1. "gRPC does not require authentication" - Updated implementation
2. "Add Jackal and Axelar chains" - Added to all configurations
3. "Channels from overall relaying data" - Noted for future implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement dynamic channel discovery API
2. Connect to real Hermes instance for packet clearing
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
