# Packet Clearing Edge Cases & Improvements

## Edge Cases Analysis

### 1. Payment Edge Cases

#### Case 1.1: Multiple Payments for Same Token
**Scenario:** User accidentally sends payment twice
**Solution:** 
- Track all payments per token
- Process first valid payment only
- Auto-refund subsequent payments minus network fees
- Log all attempts for audit

#### Case 1.2: Partial Payment
**Scenario:** User sends less than required amount
**Solution:**
- Wait for configurable grace period (30 seconds)
- Allow top-up payments within grace period
- If still insufficient, refund minus fees
- Clear notification about minimum required

#### Case 1.3: Wrong Memo Format
**Scenario:** User manually edits memo incorrectly
**Solution:**
- Fuzzy matching for common typos
- Check recent tokens for wallet within time window
- Manual intervention queue for admin
- Clear memo format in UI (copy button)

#### Case 1.4: Payment After Token Expiry
**Scenario:** User pays after 5-minute token window
**Solution:**
- Extend token validity by 2 minutes after payment detected
- If packet still clearable, proceed
- If not, full refund
- Notification system for delays

### 2. Clearing Execution Edge Cases

#### Case 2.1: Packet Already Cleared
**Scenario:** Another relayer clears packet during our process
**Solution:**
- Check packet status before execution
- Skip if already cleared
- Proportional fee refund
- Update statistics accordingly

#### Case 2.2: Hermes Connection Failure
**Scenario:** Hermes becomes unavailable mid-operation
**Solution:**
- Exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
- Queue operation for manual retry
- Partial refund if permanent failure
- Status webhook notifications

#### Case 2.3: Insufficient Gas
**Scenario:** Gas estimate was too low
**Solution:**
- Dynamic gas adjustment (up to 150% of estimate)
- Use service reserve fund if needed
- Track gas prediction accuracy
- Adjust estimation algorithm

#### Case 2.4: Channel Closed
**Scenario:** IBC channel closes during operation
**Solution:**
- Pre-execution channel status check
- Immediate full refund
- Notify user with explanation
- Remove channel from available list

### 3. Wallet & Authentication Edge Cases

#### Case 3.1: Wallet Disconnection During Flow
**Scenario:** User's wallet disconnects mid-process
**Solution:**
- Save progress in localStorage
- Resume from last step on reconnection
- Extended token validity for reconnection
- Clear progress indicators

#### Case 3.2: Wrong Chain Selected
**Scenario:** User on wrong chain when signing
**Solution:**
- Auto-detect and prompt chain switch
- Prevent transaction until correct chain
- Visual indicators for required chain
- Support for multiple chain operations

#### Case 3.3: Signature Verification Failure
**Scenario:** Signature doesn't match expected format
**Solution:**
- Support multiple wallet signature formats
- Clear error messages
- Retry mechanism
- Fallback to transaction-based auth

### 4. Data & State Edge Cases

#### Case 4.1: Database Transaction Failures
**Scenario:** DB write fails during critical operation
**Solution:**
- Use database transactions with rollback
- Write-ahead logging for recovery
- Separate read replica for queries
- Operation state reconstruction

#### Case 4.2: Redis Connection Loss
**Scenario:** Redis unavailable for token storage
**Solution:**
- Fallback to PostgreSQL temporary storage
- In-memory cache for active tokens
- Graceful degradation
- Auto-recovery when Redis returns

#### Case 4.3: Concurrent Operations
**Scenario:** Same user initiates multiple clearings
**Solution:**
- Per-wallet operation mutex
- Queue subsequent requests
- Clear UI indication of pending operations
- Option to cancel pending
